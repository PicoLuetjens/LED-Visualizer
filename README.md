# LED-Visualizer
This is the source Code of my LED Music Visualizer using an Arduino Mega with around 600 LEDs and multiple external power suplies. It needs a lot of Power if used over
longer time, but it looks sick:D

NOTE: It uses the FastLED Lybrary. So if you are using this source code please make sure you are using it under the same license as the FastLED Lybrary is available under.
